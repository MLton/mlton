# This script adds a new crosscompiler target for MLton.
#
# It takes three arguments.
#
# 1. <crossTarget>, will be used via the -b flag passed to the GCC
# cross-compiler tools.  You must already have installed the GCC
# cross-compiler tools.  This script does not do that, although you
# may find the script build-cross-gcc helpful.  <crossTarget> here
# should be the same as target in build-cross-gcc.  Examples are
# i386-pc-cygwin and sparc-sun-solaris.
#
# 2. <crossArch> specifies the target architecture.  
#    The posibilities are: sparc, x86.
#
# 3. <crossOS> specifies the target OS.
#    The possibilities are: cygwin, sunos.
#
# 4. <machine> specifies a remote machine of the target type.  After
# cross compiling the runtime, this script will ssh to that machine to
# get the values of the constants that the MLton basis library needs.
# Of course, you must be able to ssh to this machine.
#
# For example,
#   add-cross i386-pc-cygwin x86 cygwin cygwin
#   add-cross sparc-sun-solaris sparc sunos blade
# (Here cygwin happens to be the name of my Cygwin machine and blade
#  happens to be the name of my Sparc machine.)
#
# You also may need to set $libDir, which determines where the
# cross-compiler target will be installed.
