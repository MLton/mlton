# This script adds a new crosscompiler target for MLton.
#
# It takes four arguments.
#
# 1. <crossTarget>, which is waht MLton will pass via the -b flag to the GCC
#    cross-compiler tools.  You don't need to have installed these tools in order
#    to run this script, since it uses ssh and the native gcc on the target.
#    Examples of $crossTarget are i386-pc-cygwin and sparc-sun-solaris.
#
# 2. <crossArch> specifies the target architecture.  
#    The posibilities are: sparc, x86.
#
# 3. <crossOS> specifies the target OS.
#    The possibilities are: cygwin, solaris.
#
# 4. <machine> specifies a remote machine of the target type.  This script
#    will ssh to $machine to compile the runtime and to compile and run the
#    program that will print the values of all the constants that the MLton 
#    basis library needs.
#
# Here are some example uses of this script.
#
#   add-cross i386-pc-cygwin x86 cygwin cygwin
#   add-cross sparc-sun-solaris sparc solaris blade
#
# (Here cygwin happens to be the name of my Cygwin machine and blade
#  happens to be the name of my Sparc machine.)
#
# You also may need to set $libDir, which determines where the
# cross-compiler target will be installed.
