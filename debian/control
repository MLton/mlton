Description: Optimizing compiler for Standard ML
 MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler for
 Standard ML that runs on X86 machines under
 Linux, FreeBSD and Cygwin/Windows.  MLton
 generates standalone executables with excellent
 runtime performance, is SML 97 compliant, and has
 a mostly complete basis library.  MLton has
 support for profiling and a fast C FFI.  MLton
 has additional libraries for continuations,
 interval timers, random numbers, signal handlers,
 sockets, system logging, threads, and heap save
 and restore.  It also has a fast implementation
 of IntInf using the GNU multiprecision library.
