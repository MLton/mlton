Description: Optimizing compiler for Standard ML
 MLton (www.mlton.org) is a whole-program
 optimizing compiler for Standard ML that runs on
 X86 machines under Linux, FreeBSD and
 Cygwin/Windows.  MLton generates standalone
 executables with excellent runtime performance,
 is SML 97 compliant, and has a mostly complete
 basis library.  MLton has profiling, a fast C
 FFI, an interface to the GNU multiprecision
 library, and lots of useful libraries.
