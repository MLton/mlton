What is the rationale for Word8Array2 being required?
MONO_ARRAY2 isn't required.
Word8Array2 is marked optional in mono-array2.html

With the addition of Word.~, presumably ~ should be overloaded at num,
rather than intreal.

Non-opaque signature match on structure IntInf.

Ordering of comparison functions (<,>, etc.) and unary negation are
different within INTEGER and WORD.

ListPair discussion:
"Note that a function requiring equal length arguments may determine
this lazily, i.e. , it may act as though the lists have equal length
and invoke the user-supplied function argument, but raise the
exception when it arrives at the end of one list before the end of the
other."

PACK_WORD:
structure Pack<N>Big :> PACK_WORD  (* OPTIONAL *)
structure Pack<N>Little :> PACK_WORD  (* OPTIONAL *)
but PACK_WORD has
val subVec  : Word8Vector.vector * int -> LargeWord.word
i.e., reference to LargeWord.word.
Should it be
PACK_WORD
type word
val subVec  : Word8Vector.vector * int -> word
with
structure Pack<N>Big :> PACK_WORD with word = Word<N>.word  (* OPTIONAL *)
Should there be PackBig and PackLittle with word = Word.word?
Should there be PackLargeBig with word = LargeWord.word?
There aren't many structures that refine on LargeXYZ; most refine on XYZ<N>.

Math:
"The top-level structure Math provides these functions for the default
real type Real.real."
But, structure Math :> MATH has an opaque signature;
either the top-level Math structure is equal to Real.Math (which
includes the type sharing constraint), or this instance of Math should
have a sharing constraint.

IEEEReal:
toString prepends a #"~" even when the class is NAN?

PACK_REAL:
syntax/scope of where clauses in structure bindings is incorrect.
reference Real.real instead of real; 
MONO_VECTOR/MONO_ARRAY reference real instead of Real.real.

Array2:
Why no ARRAY2_REGION analagous to ARRAY_SLICE?
Types of Array2 operations don't match corresponding Array ops.
find,exists,all?  collate?
How about Matrix (== Vector2) and MATRIX_REGION?

ARRAY2/MONO_ARRAY2
Order of foldi/fold and modifyi/modify differs between them.

VECTOR_SLICE:
Description of subslice references |arr| when it should reference |sl|.

ARRAY, ARRAY_SLICE, VECTOR, VECTOR_SLICE, 
MONO_VECTOR, MONO_ARRAY:
Description of findi references appi when it should reference findi.

MONO_ARRAY:
CharArray has where type elem = char, not Char.char.

MONO_ARRAY_SLICE:
CharArraySlice has clause
where type array = CharVector.vector
which should be
where type array = CharArray.array

(In general, probably a good idea to look at the entire top-level
structure/signature matches and choose a consistent usage of base
types.  For example, Int:>INTEGER would seem to hide the top-level
int; unless Int is opened afterwards.  But, then what about all the
other structures that reference int?  Is top-level int = Int.int or is
Int.int = top-level int.)

MONO_{VECTOR[SLICE],ARRAY[_SLICE],ARRAY2}
Have Word<N> structures, but not Word structures.

SLICES:
Why not existsi, alli?
Should signature matching be opaque to hide implementation of 'a slice?
Rationale: maintaining the slice invariants in {Array,Vector}Slice structures
 allows use of unsafe sub and updates when iterating through elements;
 if arbitrary slices can be passed to appi, then unsafe subs aren't allowed.
 (In fact, Basis doesn't discuss what should happen in this case.)
Ordering of full, slice, subslice different in ArraySlice and VectorSlice

Array includes 'a vector;
ArraySlice references 'a VectorSlice.slice and 'a Vector.vector.
VectorSlice references 'a Vector.vector.
Presumably, 'a Array.vector = 'a Vector.vector, but no sharing constraint makes
this explicit.

Probably Vector and Array signatures matching should be opaque as well.

Vector:
Why no vector: int * 'a -> 'a vector?

CHAR
Ordering of:
val isAscii : char -> bool
val toLower : char -> char
val toUpper : char -> char
val isAlpha : char -> bool
seems bad; move isAscii down to other isXYZ
Similarly with isXYZ's (not quite alphabetical, separation of isLower
and isUpper seems awkward).


Question: 

If one defines VECTOR_SLICE by including a type 'a vector and replace
'a Vector.vector with the local 'a vector, but then binds
structure Vector: VECTOR
structure VectorSlice: VECTOR_SLICE where type 'a vector = 'a Vector.vector
at the top-level, does one violate the basis spec?
Rationale: it's easiset to implement Vector and VectorSlice simultaneously, say 
with VectorSlice as a substructure of Vector (in fact, with all of the Vector operations
being dispatched to the corresponding VectorSlice ops with full slices),
so Vector isn't in scope for the VECTOR_SLICE.




MLton specific:
 + why are Int32_gtu and Int32_geu primitive?
   Why not just Word.fromInt and use Word comparisons?
 + Real:>REAL doesn't match basis because it may peform
    arithmetic at extended precision.  Should this be mentioned
    in the user guide?
 + QUESTION: proc-env.sml
 + QUESTION: char.sml
 + check uses of {Vector,Array}Slice.slice for replacement by unsafeSlice.
