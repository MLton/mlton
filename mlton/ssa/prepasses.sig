      (* A critical edge is one that connects a block with two or more
       * succesors to one with two or more predecessors.
       * This prepass breaks all critical edges by inserting an eta-block.
       * For some analyses and transformations, simply ensuring the unique
       * successor or predecessor property is sufficient.  (For example, see
       * the comments at the end of "Conditional Constant Propagation" in
       * Section 19.3 of Appel's "Modern Compiler Implementation in ML".) 
       * However, passes that require critical edges to be broken in order
       * to accomodate code motion (for example, PRE), should also break an
       * edge that connects a block with non-functional control transfer to
       * one with two or more predecessors.
