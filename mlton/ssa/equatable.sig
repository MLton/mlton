 * Equatable values can be equated, after which they are equals.  Equating
 * two value requires the client to specify how to compute the new value from
 * the old.
 *
 * Equatable values can be either created by "new" or "delay".  In the case of
 * delay, the value is only computed if "value" is called.
 *
 * Equating a value created by delay with a value created by new will completely
 * drop the delayed value.  Hence, if a value is delayed, then nothing should
 * be assumed about any of its subcomponents.
