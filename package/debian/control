Description: Optimizing compiler for Standard ML - Compiler package
 MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler
 for Standard ML.  MLton generates standalone 
 executables with excellent runtime performance,
 is SML 97 compliant, and has a complete basis
 library.  MLton has source-level profiling,
 a fast C FFI, an interface to the GNU
 multiprecision library, and lots of useful
 libraries.

 This package includes the compiler itself.
