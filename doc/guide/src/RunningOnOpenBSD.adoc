= RunningOnOpenBSD

MLton runs fine on http://www.openbsd.org/[OpenBSD].

== Known issues

* The https://raw.github.com/MLton/mlton/master/regression/socket.sml[`socket.sml`] regression
test fails.  We suspect this is not a bug and is simply due to our
test relying on a certain behavior when connecting to a socket that
has not yet accepted, which is handled differently on OpenBSD than
other platforms.  Any help in understanding and resolving this issue
is appreciated.
