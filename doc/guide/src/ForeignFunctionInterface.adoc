= ForeignFunctionInterface

MLton's foreign function interface (FFI) extends Standard ML and makes
it easy to take the address of C global objects, access C global
variables, call from SML to C, and call from C to SML.  MLton also
provides <<MLNLFFI#,ML-NLFFI>>, which is a higher-level FFI for calling
C functions and manipulating C data from SML.
