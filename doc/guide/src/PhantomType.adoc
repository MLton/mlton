= PhantomType

A phantom type is a type that has no run-time representation, but is
used to force the type checker to ensure invariants at compile time.
This is done by augmenting a type with additional arguments (phantom
type variables) and expressing constraints by choosing phantom types
to stand for the phantom types in the types of values.
