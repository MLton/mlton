= MLNLFFIGen

`mlnlffigen` generates a <<MLNLFFI#>> binding from a collection of `.c`
files. It is based on the <<CKitLibrary#>>, which is primarily designed
to handle standardized C and thus does not understand many (any?)
compiler extensions; however, it attempts to recover from errors when
seeing unrecognized definitions.

In order to work around common gcc extensions, it may be useful to add
`-cppopt` options to the command line; for example
`-cppopt '-D__extension__'` may be occasionally useful. Fortunately,
most portable libraries largely avoid the use of these types of
extensions in header files.

`mlnlffigen` will normally not generate bindings for `#included`
files; see `-match` and `-allSU` if this is desirable.
