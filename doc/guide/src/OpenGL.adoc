= OpenGL

There are at least two interfaces to OpenGL for MLton/SML, both of
which should be considered alpha quality.

* <<MikeThomas#>> built a low-level interface, directly translating
many of the functions, covering GL, GLU, and GLUT.  This is available
in the MLton <<Sources#>>:
https://github.com/MLton/mltonlib/tree/master/org/mlton/mike/opengl[`opengl`].  The code
contains a number of small, standard OpenGL examples translated to
SML.

* <<ChrisClearwater#>> has written at least an interface to GL, and
possibly more.  See
** http://mlton.org/pipermail/mlton/2005-January/026669.html

<<Contact#>> us for more information or an update on the status of
these projects.
