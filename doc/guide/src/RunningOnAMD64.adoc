= RunningOnAMD64

MLton runs fine on the AMD64 (aka "x86-64" or "x64") architecture.

== Notes

* When compiling for AMD64, MLton targets the 64-bit ABI.

* On AMD64, MLton supports native code generation (`-codegen native` or `-codegen amd64`).

* When compiling for AMD64, MLton uses `-align 8` by default.  Using
`-align 4` may be incompatible with optimized builds of the <<GMP#>>
library, which assume 8-byte alignment.  (See the thread at
http://www.mlton.org/pipermail/mlton/2009-October/030674.html for more
details.)
