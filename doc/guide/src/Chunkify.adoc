Chunkify
========

<:Chunkify:> is an analysis pass for the <:RSSA:>
<:IntermediateLanguage:>, invoked from <:ToMachine:>.

== Description ==

It partitions all the labels (function and block) in an <:RSSA:>
program into disjoint sets, referred to as chunks.

== Implementation ==

* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/chunkify.sig)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/chunkify.fun)>

== Details and Notes ==

Breaking large <:RSSA:> functions into chunks is necessary for
reasonable compile times with the <:CCodegen:> and the <:LLVMCodegen:>.
