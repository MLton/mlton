= AndreiFormiga

I'm a graduate student just back in academia. I study concurrent and parallel systems, with a great deal of interest in programming languages (theory, design, implementation). I happen to like functional languages.

I use the nickname tautologico on #sml and my email is andrei DOT formiga AT gmail DOT com.
