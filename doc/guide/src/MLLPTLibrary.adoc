MLLPTLibrary
============

The
http://smlnj-gforge.cs.uchicago.edu/projects/ml-lpt/[ML-LPT Library]
is a support library for the <:MLULex:> scanner generator and the
<:MLAntlr:> parser generator.  The ML-LPT Library is distributed with
SML/NJ.

As of 20180119, MLton includes the ML-LPT Library synchronized with
SML/NJ version 110.82.

== Usage ==

* You can import the ML-LPT Library into an MLB file with:
+
[options="header"]
|=====
|MLB file|Description
|`$(SML_LIB)/mllpt-lib/mllpt-lib.mlb`|
|=====

* If you are porting a project from SML/NJ's <:CompilationManager:> to
MLton's <:MLBasis: ML Basis system> using `cm2mlb`, note that the
following map is included by default:
+
----
# MLLPT Library
$ml-lpt-lib.cm                          $(SML_LIB)/mllpt-lib
$ml-lpt-lib.cm/ml-lpt-lib.cm            $(SML_LIB)/mllpt-lib/mllpt-lib.mlb
----
+
This will automatically convert a `$/mllpt-lib.cm` import in an input
`.cm` file into a `$(SML_LIB)/mllpt-lib/mllpt-lib.mlb` import in the
output `.mlb` file.
