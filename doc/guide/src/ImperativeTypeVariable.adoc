= ImperativeTypeVariable

In <<StandardML#,Standard ML>>, an imperative type variable is a type
variable whose second character is a digit, as in `'1a` or
`'2b`.  Imperative type variables were used as an alternative to
the <<ValueRestriction#>> in an earlier version of SML, but no longer play
a role.  They are treated exactly as other type variables.
