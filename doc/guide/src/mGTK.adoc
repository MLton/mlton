= mGTK

http://mgtk.sourceforge.net/[mGTK] is a wrapper for
http://www.gtk.org/[GTK+], a GUI toolkit.

We recommend using mGTK 0.93, which is not listed on their home page,
but is available at the
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=23226&package_id=16523[file
release page].  To test it, after unpacking, do `cd examples; make
mlton`, after which you should be able to run the many examples
(`signup-mlton`, `listview-mlton`, ...).
