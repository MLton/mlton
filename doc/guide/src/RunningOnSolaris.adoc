= RunningOnSolaris

MLton runs fine on Solaris.

== Notes

* You must install the `binutils`, `gcc`, and `make` packages.  You
can find out how to get these at
http://www.sunfreeware.com[sunfreeware.com].

* Making the documentation requires that you install `latex` and
`dvips`, which are available in the `tetex` package.

== Known issues

* Bootstrapping on the <<RunningOnSparc#,Sparc architecture>> is so slow
as to be impractical (many hours on a 500MHz UltraSparc).  For this
reason, we strongly recommend building with a
<<CrossCompiling#,cross compiler>>.
