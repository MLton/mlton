= RunningOnIA64

MLton runs fine on the IA64 architecture.

== Notes

* When compiling for IA64, MLton targets the 64-bit ABI.

* When compiling for IA64, MLton doesn't support native code
generation (`-codegen native`).  Hence, performance is not as good as
it might be and compile times are longer.  Also, the quality of code
generated by `gcc` is important.  By default, MLton calls `gcc -O1`.
You can change this by calling MLton with `-cc-opt -O2`.

* When compiling for IA64, MLton uses `-align 8` by default.

* On the IA64, the <<GMP#>> library supports multiple ABIs.  See the
<<GMP#>> page for more details.
