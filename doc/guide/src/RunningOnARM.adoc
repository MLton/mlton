= RunningOnARM

MLton runs fine on the ARM architecture.

== Notes

* When compiling for ARM, MLton doesn't support native code generation
(`-codegen native`).  Hence, performance is not as good as it might be
and compile times are longer.  Also, the quality of code generated by
`gcc` is important.  By default, MLton calls `gcc -O1`.  You can
change this by calling MLton with `-cc-opt -O2`.
