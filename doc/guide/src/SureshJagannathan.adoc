I am an Associate Professor at the http://www.cs.purdue.edu/[Department of Computer Science] at Purdue University.
My research focus is in programming language design and implementation, concurrency,
and distributed systems.  I am interested in various aspects of MLton, mostly related to (in no particular order): (1) control-flow analysis (2) representation
strategies (e.g., flattening), (3) IR formats, and (4) extensions for distributed programming.
