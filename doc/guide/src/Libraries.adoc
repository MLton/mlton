= Libraries

In theory every strictly conforming Standard ML program should run on
MLton.  However, often large SML projects use implementation specific
features so some "porting" is required. Here is a partial list of
software that is known to run on MLton.

* Utility libraries:
** <<SMLNJLibrary#>> - distributed with MLton
** <<MLtonLibraryProject#>> - various libraries located on the MLton subversion repository
** https://github.com/MLton/mlton/tree/master/lib/mlton[`mlton`] - the internal MLton utility library, which we hope to cleanup and make more accessible someday
** http://github.com/seanmcl/sml-ext[sml-ext], a grab bag of libraries for MLton and other SML implementations (by Sean McLaughlin)
** http://tom7misc.cvs.sourceforge.net/tom7misc/sml-lib/[sml-lib], a grab bag of libraries for MLton and other SML implementations (by <<TomMurphy#>>)
* Scanner generators:
** <<MLLPTLibrary#>> - distributed with MLton
** <<MLLex#>> - distributed with MLton
** <<MLULex#>> -
* Parser generators:
** <<MLAntlr#>> -
** <<MLLPTLibrary#>> - distributed with MLton
** <<MLYacc#>> - distributed with MLton
* Concurrency: <<ConcurrentML#>> - distributed with MLton
* Graphics
** <<SML3d#>>
** <<mGTK#>>
* Misc. libraries:
** <<CKitLibrary#>> - distributed with MLton
** <<MLRISCLibrary#>> - distributed with MLton
** <<MLNLFFI#,ML-NLFFI>> - distributed with MLton
** <<Swerve#>>, an HTTP server
** <<fxp#>>, an XML parser
