ShowProf
========

If an executable is compiled for <:Profiling:profiling>, then it
accepts a special command-line runtime system argument, `show-prof`,
that outputs information about the source functions that are profiled.
Normally, this information is used by `mlprof`.  This page documents
the `show-prof` output format, and is intended for those working on
the profiler internals.

The `show-prof` output is ASCII, and consists of a sequence of lines.

* The magic number of the executable.
* The number of source names in the executable.
* A line for each source name giving the name of the function, a tab,
the filename of the file containing the function, a colon, a space,
and the line number that the function starts on in that file.
* The number of (split) source functions.
* A line for each (split) source function, where each line consists of
a source-name index (into the array of source names) and a successors
index (into the array of split-source sequences, defined below).
* The number of split-source sequences.
* A line for each split-source sequence, where each line is a space
separated list of (split) source functions.

The latter two arrays, split sources and split-source sequences,
define a directed graph, which is the call-graph of the program.
