Poplog
======

http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/research/poplog/poplog.info.html[POPLOG] is a
development environment that includes implementations of a number of
languages, including <:StandardML:Standard ML>.

While POPLOG is actively developed, the <:ML:> support predates
<:DefinitionOfStandardML:SML'97>, and there is no support for the
<:BasisLibrary:Basis Library>
http://www.standardml.org/Basis[specification].
