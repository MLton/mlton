VesaKarvonen
============

Vesa Karvonen is a student at the http://www.cs.helsinki.fi/index.en.html[University of Helsinki].
His interests lie in programming techniques that allow complex programs to be expressed
clearly and concisely and the design and implementation of programming languages.

Things he'd like to see for SML and hopes to be able to contribute towards:

* A practical tool for documenting libraries. Preferably one that is
based on extracting the documentation from source code comments.

* A good IDE. Possibly an enhanced SML mode (`esml-mode`) for Emacs.
Google for http://www.google.com/search?&q=SLIME+video[SLIME video] to
get an idea of what he'd like to see. Some specific notes:
+
--
  * show type at point
  * robust, consistent indentation
  * show documentation
  * jump to definition (see <:EmacsDefUseMode:>)
--
+
<:EmacsBgBuildMode:> has also been written for working with MLton.

* Documented and cataloged libraries. Perhaps something like
http://www.boost.org[Boost], but for SML libraries.  Here is a partial
list of libraries, tools, and frameworks Vesa is or has been working
on:
+
--
  * Asynchronous Programming Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/async/unstable/README)>)
  * Extended Basis Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/extended-basis/unstable/README)>)
  * Generic Programming Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/generic/unstable/README)>)
  * Pretty Printing Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/prettier/unstable/README)>)
  * Random Generator Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/random/unstable/README)>)
  * RPC (Remote Procedure Call) Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,org/mlton/vesak/rpc-lib/unstable/README)>)
  * http://www.libsdl.org/[SDL] Binding (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,org/mlton/vesak/sdl/unstable/README)>)
  * Unit Testing Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/unit-test/unstable/README)>)
  * Use Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,org/mlton/vesak/use-lib/unstable/README)>)
  * Windows Library (<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/windows/unstable/README)>)

Note that most of these libraries have been ported to several <:StandardMLImplementations:SML implementations>.
