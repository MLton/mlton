RunningOnFreeBSD
================

MLton runs fine on http://www.freebsd.org/[FreeBSD].

== Notes ==

* MLton is available as a http://www.freebsd.org/[FreeBSD]
http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=mlton&stype=all[port].

== Known issues ==

* Executables often run more slowly than on a comparable Linux
machine.  We conjecture that part of this is due to costs due to heap
resizing and kernel zeroing of pages.  Any help in solving the problem
would be appreciated.

* FreeBSD defaults to a datasize limit of 512M, even if you have more
than that amount of memory in the computer. Hence, your MLton process
will be limited in the amount of memory it has. To fix this problem,
turn up the datasize and the default datasize available to a process:
Edit `/boot/loader.conf` to set the limits. For example, the setting
+
----
   kern.maxdsiz="671088640"
   kern.dfldsiz="671088640"
   kern.maxssiz="134217728"
----
+
will give a process 640M of datasize memory, default to 640M available
and set 128M of stack size memory.
