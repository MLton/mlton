Drawbacks
=========

MLton has several drawbacks due to its use of whole-program
compilation.

* Large compile-time memory requirement.
+
Because MLton performs whole-program analysis and optimization,
compilation requires a large amount of memory.  For example, compiling
MLton (over 140K lines) requires at least 512M RAM.

* Long compile times.
+
Whole-program compilation can take a long time.  For example,
compiling MLton (over 140K lines) on a 1.6GHz machine takes five to
ten minutes.

* No interactive top level.
+
Because of whole-program compilation, MLton does not provide an
interactive top level.  In particular, it does not implement the
optional <:BasisLibrary:Basis Library> function `use`.
