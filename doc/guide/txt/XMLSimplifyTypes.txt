XMLSimplifyTypes
================

<:XMLSimplifyTypes:> is an optimization pass for the <:XML:>
<:IntermediateLanguage:>, invoked from <:XMLSimplify:>.

== Description ==

This pass simplifies types in an <:XML:> program, eliminating all
unused type arguments.

== Implementation ==

* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/xml/simplify-types.sig)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/xml/simplify-types.fun)>

== Details and Notes ==

It first computes a simple fixpoint on all the `datatype` declarations
to determine which `datatype` `tycon` args are actually used.  Then it
does a single pass over the program to determine which polymorphic
declaration type variables are used, and rewrites types to eliminate
unused type arguments.

This pass should eliminate any spurious duplication that the
<:Monomorphise:> pass might perform due to phantom types.
