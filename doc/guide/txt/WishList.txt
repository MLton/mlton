This page is mainly for recording recurring feature requests.  If you
have a new feature request, you probably want to query interest on one
of the <:Contact:mailing lists> first.

Please be aware of MLton's policy on
<:LanguageChanges:language changes>.  Nonetheless, we hope to provide
support for some of the "immediate" <:SuccessorML:> proposals in a
future release.


== Support for link options in ML Basis files ==

Introduce a mechanism to specify link options in <:MLBasis:ML Basis>
files.  For example, generalizing a bit, a ML Basis declaration of the
form

----
option "option"
----

could be introduced whose semantics would be the same (as closely as
possible) as if the option string were specified on the compiler
command line.

The main motivation for this is that a MLton library that would
introduce bindings (through <:ForeignFunctionInterface:FFI>) to an
external library could be packaged conveniently as a single MLB file.
For example, to link with library `foo` the MLB file would simply
contain:

----
option "-link-opt -lfoo"
----
