RunningOnPowerPC
================

MLton runs fine on the PowerPC architecture.

== Notes ==

* When compiling for PowerPC, MLton targets the 32-bit PowerPC
architecture.

* When compiling for PowerPC, MLton doesn't support native code
generation (`-codegen native`).  Hence, performance is not as good as
it might be and compile times are longer.  Also, the quality of code
generated by `gcc` is important.  By default, MLton calls `gcc -O1`.
You can change this by calling MLton with `-cc-opt -O2`.

* On the PowerPC, the <:GnuMP:> library supports multiple ABIs.  See
the <:GnuMP:> page for more details.
