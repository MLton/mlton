Flatten
=======

<:Flatten:> is an optimization pass for the <:SSA:>
<:IntermediateLanguage:>, invoked from <:SSASimplify:>.

== Description ==

This pass flattens arguments to <:SSA:> constructors, blocks, and
functions.

If a tuple is explicitly available at all uses of a function
(resp. block), then:

* The formals and call sites are changed so that the components of the
tuple are passed.

* The tuple is reconstructed at the beginning of the body of the
function (resp. block).

Similarly, if a tuple is explicitly available at all uses of a
constructor, then:

* The constructor argument datatype is changed to flatten the tuple
type.

* The tuple is passed flat at each `ConApp`.

* The tuple is reconstructed at each `Case` transfer target.

== Implementation ==
