XMLSimplify
===========

The optimization passes for the <:XML:> <:IntermediateLanguage:> are
collected and controlled by the `XmlSimplify` functor
(<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/xml/xml-simplify.sig)>,
<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/xml/xml-simplify.fun)>).

The following optimization passes are implemented:

* <:XMLSimplifyTypes:>
* <:XMLShrink:>

The optimization passes can be controlled from the command-line by the options

* `-diag-pass <pass>` -- keep diagnostic info for pass
* `-drop-pass <pass>` -- omit optimization pass
* `-keep-pass <pass>` -- keep the results of pass
* `-xml-passes <passes>` -- xml optimization passes
