RunningOnAlpha
==============

MLton runs fine on the Alpha architecture.

== Notes ==

* When compiling for Alpha, MLton doesn't support native code
generation (`-codegen native`).  Hence, performance is not as good as
it might be and compile times are longer.  Also, the quality of code
generated by `gcc` is important.  By default, MLton calls `gcc -O1`.
You can change this by calling MLton with `-cc-opt -O2`.

* When compiling for Alpha, MLton uses `-align 8` by default.
