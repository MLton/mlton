RunningOnOpenBSD
================

MLton runs fine on http://www.openbsd.org/[OpenBSD].

== Known issues ==

* The <!RawGitFile(mlton,master,regression/socket.sml)> regression
test fails.  We suspect this is not a bug and is simply due to our
test relying on a certain behavior when connecting to a socket that
has not yet accepted, which is handled differently on OpenBSD than
other platforms.  Any help in understanding and resolving this issue
is appreciated.
