SSA2Simplify
============

The optimization passes for the <:SSA2:> <:IntermediateLanguage:> are
collected and controlled by the `Simplify2` functor
(<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/ssa/simplify2.sig)>,
<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/ssa/simplify2.fun)>).

The following optimization passes are implemented:

* <:DeepFlatten:>
* <:RefFlatten:>
* <:RemoveUnused:>
* <:Zone:>

There are additional analysis and rewrite passes that augment many of the other optimization passes:

* <:Restore:>
* <:Shrink:>

The optimization passes can be controlled from the command-line by the options

* `-diag-pass <pass>` -- keep diagnostic info for pass
* `-drop-pass <pass>` -- omit optimization pass
* `-keep-pass <pass>` -- keep the results of pass
* `-loop-passes <n>` -- loop optimization passes
* `-ssa2-passes <passes>` -- ssa optimization passes
