RunningOnSolaris
================

MLton runs fine on Solaris.

== Notes ==

* You must install the `binutils`, `gcc`, and `make` packages.  You
can find out how to get these at
http://www.sunfreeware.com[sunfreeware.com].

* Making the documentation requires that you install `latex` and
`dvips`, which are available in the `tetex` package.

== Known issues ==

* Bootstrapping on the <:RunningOnSparc:Sparc architecture> is so slow
as to be impractical (many hours on a 500MHz UltraSparc).  For this
reason, we strongly recommend building with a
<:CrossCompiling:cross compiler>.
