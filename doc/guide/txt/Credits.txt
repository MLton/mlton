MLton was designed and implemented by HenryCejtin,
MatthewFluet, SureshJagannathan, and <:StephenWeeks:>.

 * <:HenryCejtin:> wrote the `IntInf` implementation, the original
 profiler, the original man pages, the `.spec` files for the RPMs,
 and lots of little hacks to speed stuff up.

 * <:MatthewFluet:> implemented the X86 and AMD64 native code generators,
 ported `mlprof` to work with the native code generator, did a lot
 of work on the SSA optimizer, both adding new optimizations and
 improving or porting existing optimizations, updated the
 <:BasisLibrary:Basis Library> implementation, ported
 <:ConcurrentML:> and <:MLNLFFI:ML-NLFFI> to MLton, implemented the
 <:MLBasis: ML Basis system>, and ported MLton to 64-bit platforms.

 * <:SureshJagannathan:> implemented some early inlining and uncurrying
 optimizations.

 * <:StephenWeeks:> implemented most of the original version of MLton, and
 continues to keep his fingers in most every part.

Many people have helped us over the years.  Here is an alphabetical
list.

 * <:JesperLouisAndersen:> sent several patches to improve the runtime on
 FreeBSD and ported MLton to run on NetBSD and OpenBSD.

 * <:JohnnyAndersen:> implemented `BinIO`, modified MLton so it could
 cross compile to MinGW, and provided useful discussion about
 cross-compilation.

 * Alain Deutsch and
 http://www.polyspace.com/[PolySpace Technologies] provided many bug
 fixes and runtime system improvements, code to help the Sparc/Solaris
 port, and funded a number of improvements to MLton.

 * Martin Elsman provided helpful discussions in the development of
 the <:MLBasis:ML Basis system>.

 * Brent Fulgham ported MLton most of the way to MinGW.

 * <:AdamGoode:> provided the script to build the PDF MLton Guide.

 * Simon Helsen provided bug reports, suggestions, and helpful
 discussions.

 * Joe Hurd provided useful discussion and feedback on source-level
 profiling.

 * <:VesaKarvonen:> contributed `esml-mode.el` and `esml-mlb-mode.el` (see <:Emacs:>),
 contributed patches for improving match warnings,
 contributed `esml-du-mlton.el` and extended def-use output to include types of variable definitions (see <:EmacsDefUseMode:>), and
 improved constant folding of floating-point operations.

 * Richard Kelsey provided helpful discussions.

 * Ville Laurikari ported MLton to IA64/HPUX, HPPA/HPUX, PowerPC/AIX, PowerPC64/AIX.

 * Geoffrey Mainland helped with FreeBSD packaging.

 * Eric McCorkle ported MLton to Intel Mac.

 * <:TomMurphy:> wrote the original version of `MLton.Syslog` as part
 of his `mlftpd` project, and has sent many useful bug reports and
 suggestions.

 * Michael Neumann helped to patch the runtime to compile under
 FreeBSD.

 * Barak Pearlmutter built the original
 http://packages.debian.org/mlton[Debian package] for MLton, and
 helped us to take over the process.

 * Filip Pizlo ported MLton to (PowerPC) Darwin.

 * John Reppy assisted in porting MLton to Intel Mac.

 * Sam Rushing ported MLton to FreeBSD.

 * Jeffrey Mark Siskind provided helpful discussions and inspiration
 with his Stalin Scheme compiler.

 * <:WesleyTerpstra:> added support for `MLton.Process.create`, made
 a number of contributions to the ForeignFunctionInterface,
 contributed a number of other runtime system patches, and
 added support for compiling to a C library.

 * Luke Ziarek assisted in porting MLton to (PowerPC) Darwin.

We have also benefited from other software development tools and
used code from other sources.

 * MLton was developed using
 <:SMLNJ:Standard ML of New Jersey> and the
 <:CompilationManager:Compilation Manager (CM)>

 * MLton's lexer (`mlton/frontend/ml.lex`), parser
 (`mlton/frontend/ml.grm`), and precedence-parser
 (`mlton/elaborate/precedence-parse.fun`) are modified versions of
 code from SML/NJ.

 * The MLton <:BasisLibrary:Basis Library> implementation of
 conversions between binary and decimal representations of reals uses
 David Gay's http://www.netlib.org/fp/[gdtoa] library.

 * The MLton <:BasisLibrary:Basis Library> implementation uses
 modified versions of  portions of the the SML/NJ Basis Library
 implementation modules `OS.IO`, `Posix.IO`, `Process`,
 and `Unix`.

 * The MLton <:BasisLibrary:Basis Library> implementation uses
 modified versions of portions of the <:MLKit:ML Kit> Version 4.1.4
 Basis Library implementation modules `Path`, `Time`, and
 `Date`.

 * Many of the benchmarks come from the SML/NJ benchmark suite.

 * Many of the regression tests come from the ML Kit Version 4.1.4
 distribution, which borrowed them from the
 http://www.dina.kvl.dk/~sestoft/mosml.html[Moscow ML] distribution.

 * MLton uses the http://www.gnu.org/software/gmp/gmp.html[GNU multiprecision library] for its implementation of `IntInf`.

 * MLton's implementation of <:MLLex: mllex>, <:MLYacc: mlyacc>,
 the <:CKitLibrary:ckit Library>,
 the <:MLRISCLibrary:MLRISC Library>,
 the <:SMLNJLibrary:SML/NJ Library>,
 <:ConcurrentML:Concurrent ML>,
 mlnlffigen and <:MLNLFFI:ML-NLFFI>
 are modified versions of code from SML/NJ.
