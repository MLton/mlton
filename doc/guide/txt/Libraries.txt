Libraries
=========

In theory every strictly conforming Standard ML program should run on
MLton.  However, often large SML projects use implementation specific
features so some "porting" is required. Here is a partial list of
software that is known to run on MLton.

* Utility libraries:
** <:SMLNJLibrary:> - distributed with MLton
** <:MLtonLibraryProject:> - various libraries located on the MLton subversion repository
** <!ViewGitDir(mlton,master,lib/mlton)> - the internal MLton utility library, which we hope to cleanup and make more accessible someday

** http://tom7misc.cvs.sourceforge.net/tom7misc/sml-lib/[sml-lib], a grab bag of libraries for MLton and other SML implementations (by <:TomMurphy:>)
* Scanner generators:
** <:MLLPTLibrary:> - distributed with MLton
** <:MLLex:> - distributed with MLton
** <:MLULex:> -
* Parser generators:
** <:MLAntlr:> -
** <:MLLPTLibrary:> - distributed with MLton
** <:MLYacc:> - distributed with MLton
* Concurrency: <:ConcurrentML:> - distributed with MLton
* Graphics
** <:SML3d:>
** <:mGTK:>
* Misc. libraries:
** <:CKitLibrary:> - distributed with MLton
** <:MLRISCLibrary:> - distributed with MLton
