== Basis fragments ==

There are a number of specialized ML Basis files for importing
fragments of the <:BasisLibrary: Basis Library> that can not be
expressed within SML.

* `$(SML_LIB)/basis/pervasive-types.mlb`
+
The top-level types and constructors of the Basis Library.

* `$(SML_LIB)/basis/pervasive-exns.mlb`
+
The top-level exception constructors of the Basis Library.

* `$(SML_LIB)/basis/pervasive-vals.mlb`
+
The top-level values of the Basis Library, without infix status.

* `$(SML_LIB)/basis/overloads.mlb`
+
The top-level overloaded values of the Basis Library, without infix status.

* `$(SML_LIB)/basis/equal.mlb`
+
The polymorphic equality `=` and inequality `<>` values, without infix status.

* `$(SML_LIB)/basis/infixes.mlb`
+
The infix declarations of the Basis Library.

* `$(SML_LIB)/basis/pervasive.mlb`
+
The entire top-level value and type environment of the Basis Library, with infix status.  This is the same as importing the above six MLB files.
