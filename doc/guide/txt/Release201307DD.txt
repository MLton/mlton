Elsewhere you can download newer, <:Experimental:> releases.

== Changes since the last public release ==

// * New platforms.
// ** ???
* Compiler.
** Cosmetic improvements to type-error messages.
** Removed features:
*** Bytecode codegen: The bytecode codegen had not seen significant use and it was not well understood by any of the active developers.
*** Support for `.cm` files as input: The <:MLBasis:ML Basis system> provides much better infrastructure for "programming in the very large" than the (very) limited support for CM.  The `cm2mlb` tool (available in the source distribution) can be used to convert CM projects to MLB projects, preserving the CM scoping of module identifiers.
** Bug fixes: see <!RawGitFile(mlton,on-201307DD-release,doc/changelog)>
* Runtime.
** Bug fixes: see <!RawGitFile(mlton,on-201307DD-release,doc/changelog)>
* Language.
** Interpret `(*#line line:col "file" *)` directives as relative file names.
** <:MLBasisAnnotations:ML Basis annotations>.
*** Added: `resolveScope`
* Libraries.
** <:BasisLibrary:Basis Library>.
*** Improved performance of `String.concatWith`.
*** Use bit operations for `REAL.class` and other low-level operations.
*** Support additional variables with `Posix.ProcEnv.sysconf`.
*** Bug fixes: see <!RawGitFile(mlton,on-201307DD-release,doc/changelog)>
** <:MLtonStructure:MLton structure>.
*** Removed: `MLton.Socket`
** Other libraries.
*** Updated: <:CKitLibrary:ckit library>, <:MLRISCLibrary:MLRISC library>, <:SMLNJLibrary:SML/NJ library>
*** Added: <:MLLPTLibrary:MLLPT library>
* Tools.
** `mllex`
*** Generate `(*#line line:col "file.lex" *)` directives with simple (relative) file names, rather than absolute paths.
** `mlyacc`
*** Generate `(*#line line:col "file.grm" *)` directives with simple (relative) file names, rather than absolute paths.
