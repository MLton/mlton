Eclipse
=======

http://eclipse.org/[Eclipse] is an open, extensible IDE.

http://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in/%7Ecsu02132/mldev/[ML-Dev] is a plug-in
for Eclipse, based on <:SMLNJ:SML/NJ>.

There has been some talk on the MLton mailing list about adding
support to Eclipse for MLton/SML, and in particular, using
http://eclipsefp.sourceforge.net/.  We are unaware of any progress
along those lines.
