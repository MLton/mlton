RunningOnDarwin
===============

MLton runs fine on Darwin (and on Mac OS X).

== Notes ==

* MLton requires the <:GnuMP:> library, which is available via
http://www.finkproject.org[Fink], http://www.macports.com[MacPorts],
http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/[Homebrew].

* For Intel-based Macs, MLton targets the <:RunningOnAMD64:AMD64
architecture> on Darwin 10 (Mac OS X Snow Leopard) and higher and
targets the <:RunningOnX86:x86 architecture> on Darwin 8 (Mac OS X
Tiger) and Darwin 9 (Mac OS X Leopard).

== Known issues ==

* Executables that save and load worlds on Darwin 11 (Mac OS X Lion)
and higher should be compiled with `-link-opt -fno-PIE` ; see
<:MLtonWorld:> for more details.

* <:ProfilingTime:> may give inaccurate results on multi-processor
machines.  The `SIGPROF` signal, used to sample the profiled program,
is supposed to be delivered 100 times a second (i.e., at 10000us
intervals), but there can be delays of over 1 minute between the
delivery of consecutive `SIGPROF` signals.  A more complete
description may be found
