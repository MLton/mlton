FrontEnd
========

<:FrontEnd:> is a translation pass from source to the <:AST:>
<:IntermediateLanguage:>.

== Description ==

This pass performs lexing and parsing to produce an abstract syntax
tree.

== Implementation ==

* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/front-end/front-end.sig)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/front-end/front-end.fun)>

== Details and Notes ==

The lexer is produced by <:MLLex:> from
<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/front-end/ml.lex)>.

The parser is produced by <:MLYacc:> from
<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/front-end/ml.grm)>.

The specifications for the lexer and parser were originally taken from
<:SMLNJ: SML/NJ> (version 109.32), but have been heavily modified
since then.
