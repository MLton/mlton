OptionalArguments
=================

<:StandardML:Standard ML> does not have built-in support for optional
arguments.  Nevertheless, using <:Fold:>, it is easy to define
functions that take optional arguments.

For example, suppose that we have the following definition of a
function `f`.

[source,sml]
----
fun f (i, r, s) =
   concat [Int.toString i, ", ", Real.toString r, ", ", s]
----

Using the `OptionalArg` structure described below, we can define a
function `f'`, an optionalized version of `f`, that takes 0, 1, 2, or
3 arguments.  Embedded within `f'` will be default values for `i`,
`r`, and `s`.  If `f'` gets no arguments, then all the defaults are
used.  If `f'` gets one argument, then that will be used for `i`.  Two
arguments will be used for `i` and `r` respectively.  Three arguments
will override all default values.  Calls to `f'` will look like the
following.

[source,sml]
----
f' $
f' `2 $
f' `2 `3.0 $
f' `2 `3.0 `"four" $
----

The optional argument indicator, +&grave;+, is not special syntax ---
it is a normal SML value, defined in the `OptionalArg` structure
below.

Here is the definition of `f'` using the `OptionalArg` structure, in
particular, `OptionalArg.make` and `OptionalArg.D`.

[source,sml]
----
val f' =
   fn z =>
   let open OptionalArg in
      make (D 1) (D 2.0) (D "three") $
   end (fn i & r & s => f (i, r, s))
   z
----

The definition of `f'` is eta expanded as with all uses of fold.  A
call to `OptionalArg.make` is supplied with a variable number of
defaults (in this case, three), the end-of-arguments terminator, `$`,
and the function to run, taking its arguments as an n-ary
<:ProductType:product>.  In this case, the function simply converts
the product to an ordinary tuple and calls `f`.  Often, the function
body will simply be written directly.

In general, the definition of an optional-argument function looks like
the following.

[source,sml]
----
val f =
   fn z =>
   let open OptionalArg in
      make (D <default1>) (D <default2>) ... (D <defaultn>) $
   end (fn x1 & x2 & ... & xn =>
        <function code goes here>)
   z
----

Here is the definition of `OptionalArg`.

[source,sml]
----
structure OptionalArg =
   struct
      val make =
         fn z =>
         Fold.fold
         ((id, fn (f, x) => f x),
          fn (d, r) => fn func =>
          Fold.fold ((id, d ()), fn (f, d) =>
                     let
                        val d & () = r (id, f d)
                     in
                        func d
                     end))
         z

      fun D d = Fold.step0 (fn (f, r) =>
                            (fn ds => f (d & ds),
                             fn (f, a & b) => r (fn x => f a & x, b)))

      val ` =
         fn z =>
         Fold.step1 (fn (x, (f, _ & d)) => (fn d => f (x & d), d))
         z
   end
----

`OptionalArg.make` uses a nested fold.  The first `fold` accumulates
the default values in a product, associated to the right, and a
reversal function that converts a product (of the same arity as the
number of defaults) from right associativity to left associativity.
The accumulated defaults are used by the second fold, which recurs
over the product, replacing the appropriate component as it encounters
optional arguments.  The second fold also constructs a "fill"
function, `f`, that is used to reconstruct the product once the
end-of-arguments is reached.  Finally, the finisher reconstructs the
product and uses the reversal function to convert the product from
right associative to left associative, at which point it is passed to
the user-supplied function.

Much of the complexity comes from the fact that while recurring over a
product from left to right, one wants it to be right-associative,
e.g., look like

[source,sml]
----
a & (b & (c & d))
----

but the user function in the end wants the product to be left
associative, so that the product argument pattern can be written
without parentheses (since `&` is left associative).


== Labelled optional arguments ==

In addition to the positional optional arguments described above, it
is sometimes useful to have labelled optional arguments.  These allow
one to define a function, `f`, with defaults, say `a` and `b`.  Then,
a caller of `f` can supply values for `a` and `b` by name.  If no
value is supplied then the default is used.

Labelled optional arguments are a simple extension of
<:FunctionalRecordUpdate:> using post composition.  Suppose, for
example, that one wants a function `f` with labelled optional
arguments `a` and `b` with default values `0` and `0.0` respectively.
If one has a functional-record-update function `updateAB` for records
with `a` and `b` fields, then one can define `f` in the following way.

[source,sml]
----
val f =
   fn z =>
   Fold.post
   (updateAB {a = 0, b = 0.0},
    fn {a, b} => print (concat [Int.toString a, " ",
                                Real.toString b, "\n"]))
   z
----

The idea is that `f` is the post composition (using `Fold.post`) of
the actual code for the function with a functional-record updater that
starts with the defaults.

Here are some example calls to `f`.
[source,sml]
----
val () = f $
val () = f (U#a 13) $
val () = f (U#a 13) (U#b 17.5) $
val () = f (U#b 17.5) (U#a 13) $
----

Notice that a caller can supply neither of the arguments, either of
the arguments, or both of the arguments, and in either order.  All
that matter is that the arguments be labelled correctly (and of the
right type, of course).

Here is another example.

[source,sml]
----
val f =
   fn z =>
   Fold.post
   (updateBCD {b = 0, c = 0.0, d = "<>"},
    fn {b, c, d} =>
    print (concat [Int.toString b, " ",
                   Real.toString c, " ",
                   d, "\n"]))
   z
----

Here are some example calls.

[source,sml]
----
val () = f $
val () = f (U#d "goodbye") $
val () = f (U#d "hello") (U#b 17) (U#c 19.3) $
