* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/machine.sig)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/machine.fun)>

== Type Checking ==

The <:Machine:> <:IntermediateLanguage:> has a primitive type checker
(<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/machine.sig)>,
<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/machine.fun)>), which only checks
some liveness properties.

== Details and Notes ==

The runtime structure sets some constants according to the
configuration files on the target architecture and OS.
