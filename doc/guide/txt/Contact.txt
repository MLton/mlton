=== Mailing list policies ===

* Both mailing lists are unmoderated.  However, the mailing lists are
configured them to discard all spam, to hold all non-subscriber posts
for moderation, to accept all subscriber posts, and to admin approve
subscription requests.  Please contact
mailto:matthew.fluet@gmail.com[Matthew Fluet] if it appears that your
messages are being discarded as spam.

* Large messages (over 256K) should not be sent.  Rather, please send
an email containing the discussion text and a link to any large files.

/////
* Very active mailto:MLton-devel@mlton.org[`MLton@mlton.org`] list
members who might otherwise be expected to provide a fast response
should send a message when they will be offline for more than a few
days.  The convention is to put
"++__userid__ offline until __date__++" in the subject line to make it
easy to scan.
/////

* Discussions started on the mailing lists should stay on the mailing
lists.  Private replies may be bounced to the mailing list for the
benefit of those following the discussion.

* Discussions started on
mailto:MLton-user@mlton.org[`MLton-user@mlton.org`] may be migrated to
mailto:MLton-devel@mlton.org[`MLton-devel@mlton.org`], particularly
when the discussion shifts from how to use MLton to how to modify
MLton (e.g., to fix a bug identified by the initial discussion).

== IRC ==

* Some MLton developers and users are in channel `#sml` on http://freenode.net.
