DefinitionOfStandardML
======================

<!Cite(MilnerEtAl97, The Definition of Standard ML (Revised))> is a
terse and formal specification of <:StandardML:Standard ML>'s syntax
and semantics.  The language specified by this book is often referred
to as SML 97.

<!Cite(MilnerEtAl90, The Definition of Standard ML)> is an older
version of the definition, published in 1990. The accompanying
<!Cite(MilnerTofte91, Commentary)> introduces and explains the notation
and approach. The same notation is used in the SML 97 definition, so it
is worth keeping the older definition and its commentary at hand if you
intend a close study of the definition.
