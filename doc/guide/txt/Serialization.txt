Serialization
=============

<:StandardML:Standard ML> does not have built-in support for
serialization.  Here are papers that describe user-level approaches:

* <!Cite(Elsman04)>
* <!Cite(Kennedy04)>

The MLton repository also contains an experimental generic programming
library (see
<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/generic/unstable/README)>) that
includes a pickling (serialization) generic (see
<!ViewGitFile(mltonlib,master,com/ssh/generic/unstable/public/value/pickle.sig)>).
