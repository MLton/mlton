Here are the known bugs in <:Release20070826:MLton 20070826>, listed
in reverse chronological order of date reported.

* <!Anchor(bug25)>
 Bug in the mark-compact garbage collector where the C library's `memcpy` was used to move objects during the compaction phase; this could lead to heap corruption and segmentation faults with newer versions of gcc and/or glibc, which assume that src and dst in a `memcpy` do not overlap.
 Fixed by revision <!ViewSVNRev(7461)>.
