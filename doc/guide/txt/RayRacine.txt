Current areas of coding.

. Pretty solid, high performance Rete implementation - base functionality is complete.
. N3 parser - mostly complete
. RDF parser based on fxg - not started.
. Swerve HTTP server - 1/2 done.
. SPARQL implementation - not started.
. Persistent engine based on BerkelyDB - not started.
. Native implementation of Postgresql protocol - underway, ways to go.
. I also have a small change to the MLton compiler to add ++PackWord__<N>__++ - changes compile but needs some more work, clean-up and unit tests.
