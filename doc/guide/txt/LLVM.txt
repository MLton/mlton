LLVM
====

http://www.llvm.org/[LLVM] (Low Level Virtual Machine) is an abstract
machine, optimizer, and code generator.  It might make a nice backend
for MLton, and there has been some discussion about this on the MLton
list.

The latest is that LLVM's `gcc` variant has been used in place of
`gcc`, and so there has been no work toward changing MLton to target
LLVM's IL directly.
