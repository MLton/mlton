OpenGL
======

There are at least two interfaces to OpenGL for MLton/SML, both of
which should be considered alpha quality.

* <:MikeThomas:> built a low-level interface, directly translating
many of the functions, covering GL, GLU, and GLUT.  This is available
in the MLton <:Sources:>:
<!ViewGitDir(mltonlib,master,org/mlton/mike/opengl)>.  The code
contains a number of small, standard OpenGL examples translated to
SML.

* <:ChrisClearwater:> has written at least an interface to GL, and
possibly more.  See
** http://mlton.org/pipermail/mlton/2005-January/026669.html

<:Contact:> us for more information or an update on the status of
these projects.
