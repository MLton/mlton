MLLex
=====

<:MLLex:> is a lexical analyzer generator for <:StandardML:Standard ML>
modeled after the Lex lexical analyzer generator.

A version of MLLex, ported from the <:SMLNJ:SML/NJ> sources, is
distributed with MLton.

== Description ==

MLLex takes as input the lex language as defined in the ML-Lex manual,
and outputs a lexical analyzer in SML.

== Implementation ==

* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mllex/lexgen.sml)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mllex/main.sml)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mllex/call-main.sml)>

== Details and Notes ==

There are 3 main passes in the MLLex tool:

* Source parsing. In this pass, lex source program are parsed into internal representations. The core part of this pass is a hand-written lexer and an LL(1) parser. The output of this pass is a record of user code, rules (along with start states) and actions. (MLLex definitions are wiped off.)
* DFA construction. In this pass, a DFA is constructed by the algorithm of H. Yamada et. al.
* Output. In this pass, the generated DFA is written out as a transition table, along with a table-driven algorithm, to an SML file.
