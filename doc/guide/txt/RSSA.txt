RSSA
====

<:RSSA:> is an <:IntermediateLanguage:>, translated from <:SSA2:> by
<:ToRSSA:>, optimized by <:RSSASimplify:>, and translated by
<:ToMachine:> to <:Machine:>.

== Description ==

<:RSSA:> is a <:IntermediateLanguage:> that makes representation
decisions explicit.

== Implementation ==

* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/rssa.sig)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/rssa.fun)>

== Type Checking ==

The new type language is aimed at expressing bit-level control over
layout and associated packing of data representations.  There are
singleton types that denote constants, other atomic types for things
like integers and reals, and arbitrary sum types and sequence (tuple)
types.  The big change to the type system is that type checking is now
based on subtyping, not type equality.  So, for example, the singleton
type `0xFFFFEEBB` whose only inhabitant is the eponymous constant is a
subtype of the type `Word32`.

== Details and Notes ==

SSA is an abbreviation for Static Single Assignment.  The <:RSSA:>
<:IntermediateLanguage:> is a variant of SSA.
