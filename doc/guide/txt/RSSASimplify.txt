RSSASimplify
============

The optimization passes for the <:RSSA:> <:IntermediateLanguage:> are
collected and controlled by the `Backend` functor
(<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/backend.sig)>,
<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/backend/backend.fun)>).

The following optimization pass is implemented:

* <:RSSAShrink:>

The following implementation passes are implemented:

* <:ImplementHandlers:>
* <:ImplementProfiling:>
* <:InsertLimitChecks:>
* <:InsertSignalChecks:>

The optimization passes can be controlled from the command-line by the options

* `-diag-pass <pass>` -- keep diagnostic info for pass
* `-drop-pass <pass>` -- omit optimization pass
* `-keep-pass <pass>` -- keep the results of pass
