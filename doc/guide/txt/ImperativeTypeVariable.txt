ImperativeTypeVariable
======================

In <:StandardML:Standard ML>, an imperative type variable is a type
variable whose second character is a digit, as in `'1a` or
`'2b`.  Imperative type variables were used as an alternative to
the <:ValueRestriction:> in an earlier version of SML, but no longer play
a role.  They are treated exactly as other type variables.
