* `type t`
+
type of monomorphic vector

* `type elem`
+
type of vector elements

* `fromPoly v`
+
type cast a polymorphic vector to its monomorphic counterpart; in
MLton, this is a constant-time operation

* `toPoly v`
+
type cast a monomorphic vector to its polymorphic counterpart; in
MLton, this is a constant-time operation
