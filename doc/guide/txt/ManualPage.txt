==========

MLton is run from the command line with a collection of options
followed by a file name and a list of files to compile, assemble, and
link with.

----
mlton [option ...] file.{c|mlb|o|sml} [file.{c|o|s|S} ...]
----

The simplest case is to run `mlton foo.sml`, where `foo.sml` contains
a valid SML program, in which case MLton compiles the program to
produce an executable `foo`.  Since MLton does not support separate
compilation, the program must be the entire program you wish to
compile.  However, the program may refer to signatures and structures
defined in the <:BasisLibrary:Basis Library>.

Larger programs, spanning many files, can be compiled with the
<:MLBasis:ML Basis system>.  In this case, `mlton foo.mlb` will
compile the complete SML program described by the basis `foo.mlb`,
which may specify both SML files and additional bases.
