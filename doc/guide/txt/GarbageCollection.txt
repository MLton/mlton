GarbageCollection
=================

For a good introduction and overview to garbage collection, see
<!Cite(Jones99)>.

MLton's garbage collector uses copying, mark-compact, and generational
collection, automatically switching between them at run time based on
the amount of live data relative to the amount of RAM.  The runtime
system tries to keep the heap within RAM if at all possible.

MLton's copying collector is a simple, two-space, breadth-first,
Cheney-style collector.  The design for the generational and
mark-compact GC is based on <!Cite(Sansom91)>.
