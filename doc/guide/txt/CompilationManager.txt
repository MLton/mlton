CompilationManager
==================

The http://www.smlnj.org/doc/CM/index.html[Compilation Manager] (CM) is SML/NJ's mechanism for supporting programming-in-the-very-large.

== Porting SML/NJ CM files to MLton ==

To help in porting CM files to MLton, the MLton source distribution
includes the sources for a utility, `cm2mlb`, that will print an
<:MLBasis: ML Basis> file with essentially the same semantics as the
CM file -- handling the full syntax of CM supported by your installed
SML/NJ version and correctly handling export filters.  When `cm2mlb`
encounters a `.cm` import, it attempts to convert it to a
corresponding `.mlb` import.  CM anchored paths are translated to
paths according to a default configuration file
(<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,util/cm2mlb/cm2mlb-map)>). For example,
the default configuration includes
----
# Standard ML Basis Library
$SMLNJ-BASIS                            $(SML_LIB)/basis
$basis.cm                               $(SML_LIB)/basis
$basis.cm/basis.cm                      $(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb
----
to ensure that a `$/basis.cm` import is translated to a
`$(SML_LIB)/basis/basis.mlb` import.  See `util/cm2mlb` for details.
Building `cm2mlb` requires that you have already installed a recent
version of SML/NJ.
