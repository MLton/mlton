SXMLSimplify
============

The optimization passes for the <:SXML:> <:IntermediateLanguage:> are
collected and controlled by the `SxmlSimplify` functor
(<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/xml/sxml-simplify.sig)>,
<!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/xml/sxml-simplify.fun)>).

The following optimization passes are implemented:

* <:Polyvariance:>
* <:SXMLShrink:>

The following implementation passes are implemented:

* <:ImplementExceptions:>
* <:ImplementSuffix:>

The following optimization passes are not implemented, but might prove useful:

* <:Uncurry:>
* <:LambdaLift:>

The optimization passes can be controlled from the command-line by the options

* `-diag-pass <pass>` -- keep diagnostic info for pass
* `-drop-pass <pass>` -- omit optimization pass
* `-keep-pass <pass>` -- keep the results of pass
* `-sxml-passes <passes>` -- sxml optimization passes
