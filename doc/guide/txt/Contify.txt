Contify
=======

<:Contify:> is an optimization pass for the <:SSA:>
<:IntermediateLanguage:>, invoked from <:SSASimplify:>.

== Description ==

Contification is a compiler optimization that turns a function that
always returns to the same place into a continuation.  This exposes
control-flow information that is required by many optimizations,
including traditional loop optimizations.

== Implementation ==

* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/ssa/contify.sig)>
* <!ViewGitFile(mlton,master,mlton/ssa/contify.fun)>

== Details and Notes ==

See <!Cite(FluetWeeks01, Contification Using Dominators)>.  The
intermediate language described in that paper has since evolved to the
<:SSA:> <:IntermediateLanguage:>; hence, the complication described in
Section 6.1 is no longer relevant.
