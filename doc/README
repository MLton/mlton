     o Sparc: SunOS
   + Generates standalone executables with good runtime performance
   + SML 97 compliant, with a complete basis library (except for use)
   + Untagged native integers and unboxed native arrays
   + Fast C FFI for calling from SML to C or from C to SML
   + Source-level profiling of both time and allocation
   + Multiple garbage collection strategies
   + Supports large amounts of memory and large arrays
   + Fast IntInf based on the GNU multiprecision library (gmp)
