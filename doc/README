MLton is a whole-program optimizing compiler for the Standard ML
programming language.  MLton has the following features.

  + Portability.  
   Runs on the following platforms.
   o AMD64: FreeBSD, Linux (Debian, RedHat, ...).
   o HPPA: HPUX (11.00 and above), Linux (Debian).
   o PowerPC: AIX (5.1 and above), Darwin (Mac OS X), Linux (Debian).
   o X86: Cygwin/Windows, Darwin (Mac OS X), FreeBSD, 
      Linux (Debian, RedHat, ...), MinGW/Windows, NetBSD, OpenBSD.
   o Sparc: Linux (Debian), Solaris.
  + Robustness.
   o Supports the full SML 97 language as given in The Definition 
      of Standard ML (Revised).
   o A complete implementation of the Basis Library.
   o Generates standalone executables.
   o Compiles large programs.
   o Support for large amounts of memory (up to 4G on 32-bit systems; 
      more on 64-bit systems).
   o Array lengths up to 2^31 - 1, the largest possible 
      twos-complement 32-bit integer.
   o Supports for large files, using 64-bit file positions.
  + Performance.
   o Executables have excellent running times.
   o Generates small executables.
   o Untagged and unboxed native integers, reals, and words.
   o Unboxed native arrays.
   o Multiple garbage collection strategies.
   o Fast arbitrary-precision arithmetic based on the GnuMP.
  + Tools.
   o Source-level profiling for both time and allocation.
   o MLLex lexer generator.
   o MLYacc parser generator.
   o ML-NLFFIGEN.
  + Extensions.
   o A simple and fast C FFI that supports calling from SML to C and 
      from C to SML.
   o ML Basis system for programming in the very large.
   o Libraries for C pointers, continuations, interval timers, random
      numbers, resource limits, resource usage, signal handlers,
      system logging, threads, and heap save and restore.
