    Here is a list of companies, projects, and people that use or have
    used MLton.  If you would like to add something to the list,
    please send mail to <tt>MLton@mlton.org</tt> with a brief
    description and a link.

    <ul>
      <li> The <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~concert/">Concert Project</a>
	    uses MLton to build some of their front-end software.
      <li> <a href = "http://www.fantasy-coders.de/projects/gh/">Guugelhupf</a>,
        a simple search engine, is compiled with MLton.
      <li> <a href = "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/">Hardcore
	  Processing</a> uses MLton as a
	<a href =
	  "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/Freeware/MLTonWin32.html">crosscompiler from Linux to Windows</a> 
	for graphics and game software.
	<ul>
	  <li> <a href = "http://www.CeX3D.net/">CEX3D Converter</a>, a
	    conversion program for 3D objects.
	  <li> <a href =
		  "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/company/showreel/index.html">Interactive Showreel</a>, which contains a crossplatform GUI-toolkit  
and a realtime renderer for a subset of RenderMan written in Standard ML.
	  <li> various <a href =
		  "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/entertainment/index.html">games</a>
	</ul>
      <li> <a href =
	      "http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/proglang/research/software/mlope/">MLOPE</a>, an offline partial evaluator for Standard ML, is based on an older version of MLton.

      <li> <a href = "http://www.polyspace.com/">PolySpace Technologies</a> uses
      MLton to compile their product that detects runtime errors in embedded
      systems based on abstract interpretation.

      <li> <a href = "http://www.sourcelight.com">Sourcelight Technologies</a>
      uses MLton internally for prototyping and for processing databases as part
	    of their system that makes <a href =
					  "http://blockbuster.com/bb/recommends/">personalized movie recommendations</a>.
      <li> <a href = "http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/~twm/">Tom Murphy</a> uses MLton
	to implement <a href =
			"http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tom7misc/net/">replacements for standard network services</a> (fingerd, ftpd, identd, ...) and to compile his entries 
(<a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2001/">2001</a>,
 <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2002/">2002</a>)
for the annual ICFP programming contest.
      <li> The <a href = "http://www.twelf.org">Twelf Project</a>,
           which implements the LF logical framework,
           uses MLton to build their Linux binary RPMS.
    </ul>

    <h3>Papers</h3>
    Here are some papers that others have written about projects that
	have used MLton or comparisons of other systems and MLton.
    <ul>
      <li> <a href =
	  "http://www.daimi.au.dk/CPnets/workshop99/papers/Mortensen.ps.gz">Automatic Code Generation from Coloured Petri Nets for an Access Control System</a>
      <li> <a href = "http://user.it.uu.se/~happi/publications/flops02.pdf">The
	      HiPE/x86 Erlang Compiler: System Description and Performance
	      Evaluation</a>
         <br> <em>Describes a native x86 Erlang compiler and a comparison of
		  many different native x86 compilers (including MLton) and their
		  register usage and call stack implementations.</em>
      <li> <a href = "http://www-2.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/papers/wang-murphy-recursion.pdf">Programming With Recursion Schemes</a>
        <br> <em>Describes a programming technique for data abstraction, along
				with benchmarks of MLton and other SML
				compilers.</em> 
      <li> <a href =
	  "http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danwang/Papers/tpsrvgc/">Type-Preserving
	  Garbage Collectors</a>
        <br> <em>Shows how to generate a strongly typed garbage collector as
			  part of a program, using MLton as a practical
		      demonstration.</em>
