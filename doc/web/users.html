    Here is a list of companies, projects, and people that use or have
    used MLton.  If you would like to add something to the list,
    please send mail to <tt>MLton@mlton.org</tt> with a brief
    description and a link.

    <ul>
      <li> <a href =
		  "http://types.bu.edu/reports/Dim+Wes+Mul+Tur+Wel+Con:TIC-2000-LNCS.html">CIL</a>, a compiler for SML, uses MLton as a defunctorizer.
      <li> <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~concert/">ConCert</a>, a
	    project investigating certified code for grid computing,
	    uses MLton to build some of their front-end software.
      <li> Dan Wang and Andrew Appel showed how to modify MLton to
				    generate a strongly typed garbage 
				    collector as part of a program
				    in their paper <a href =
	  "http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~danwang/Papers/tpsrvgc/">Type-Preserving
	  Garbage Collectors</a>.
      <li> <a href = "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/">Hardcore
	  Processing</a> uses MLton as a
	<a href =
	  "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/Freeware/MLTonWin32.html">crosscompiler from Linux to Windows</a> 
	for graphics and game software.
	<ul>
	  <li> <a href = "http://www.CeX3D.net/">CEX3D Converter</a>, a
	    conversion program for 3D objects.
	  <li> <a href =
		  "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/company/showreel/index.html">Interactive Showreel</a>, which contains a crossplatform GUI-toolkit  
and a realtime renderer for a subset of RenderMan written in Standard ML.
	  <li> various <a href =
		  "http://www.HardcoreProcessing.com/entertainment/index.html">games</a>
	</ul>
      <li> Joe Hurd uses MLton to compile
<a href = "http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/users/jeh1004/research/metis/">Metis</a>,
the first-order prover used in the <a href =
				      "http://hol.sourceforge.net">HOL4 theorem proving system</a>.

 <a href = "http://www.fantasy-coders.de/projects/gh/">Guugelhupf</a>,
        a simple search engine.

      <li> Norman Ramsey uses MLton to build courseware for <a href =
		 	     "http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~nr/cs152/">CS-152</a>,
	      Harvard's undergraduate programming languages class.

      <li> <a href = "http://www.polyspace.com/">PolySpace Technologies</a> uses
      MLton to compile their product that detects runtime errors in embedded
      systems based on abstract interpretation.

      <li> Simon Helsen bases <a href =
	      "http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/proglang/research/software/mlope/">MLOPE</a>, an offline partial evaluator for Standard ML, on an early version of MLton.

      <li> <a href = "http://www.sourcelight.com">Sourcelight Technologies</a>
      uses MLton internally for prototyping and for processing databases as part
	    of their system that makes <a href =
					  "http://blockbuster.com/bb/recommends/">personalized movie recommendations</a>.
      <li> Tom Murphy uses MLton to compile <a href =
			      "http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tom7misc/net/mlftpd">mlftpd</a>, an ftp daemon, as well as other
		      <a href =
			 "http://cvs.sourceforge.net/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/tom7misc/net/">replacements for standard network services</a>.  He also uses MLton to build his entries
		    (<a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2001/">2001</a>,
		      <a href = "http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~tom7/icfp2002/">2002</a>)
		      in the annual ICFP programming contest.
