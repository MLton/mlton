This document describes how to hack {\mlton}, a
whole-program optimizing compiler for the
\htmladdnormallink{Standard ML}
                  {http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/what/smlnj/sml.html}
programming language.
The {\mlton} homepage is \absolutelink{}.
The document contains an overview of the source tree, a description of the
programming style used in {\mlton}, and delves into the bowels of the compiler
and associated tools.
