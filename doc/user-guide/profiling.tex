\sec{Profiling}{profiling}

{\mlton} has a profiling facility, {\tt mlprof}, that is similar in usage
to {\tt gprof}.  Here is an example run from within the {\tt examples/profiling}
directory showing how to generate profiling information.

\begin{verbatim}
% mlton -p -keep g profiling.sml
% profiling
% mlprof profiling mlmon.out
0.49 seconds of CPU time
tak_0               87.76%
IntInf_smallMul (C) 12.24%
\end{verbatim}
In summary, generating profiling information takes three steps.
\begin{enumerate}

\item Compile with the {\tt -p} switch.  This saves a {\tt .cps} file (see
below).  You can also use {\tt -keep g} to save the generated assembly ({\tt
.S}) files.

\item Run the executable.  This produces a file called {\tt mlmon.out}.

\item Run {\tt mlprof} on the executable and the {\tt mlmon.out} file.

\end{enumerate}
The profiling information output by {\tt mlprof} {\em does not refer to the
source program}.  Instead, {\tt mlprof} reports the percentage of time spent in
each C and CPS function.  C functions are used for the FFI and garbage
collector.  CPS is an intermediate language used by MLton that has traditional
first-order function definitions and calls and is similar to static-single
assignment form.  In the above example, {\tt tak\_0} is a CPS function (see {\tt
profiling.cps}) corresponding to the source SML {\tt tak} function.  The C
function {\tt IntInf\_smallMul} is used to implement {\tt IntInf.*}.

In translating from SML to CPS, {\mlton} attempts to preserve source names, but
due to anonymous functions, inlining, monomorphisation, closure conversion, and
other optimizations, there is often quite a difference between the source and
the optimized CPS program.  The source names are always mangled by adding a
suffix of {\tt \_n} for some n (e.g. {\tt tak\_0}).  Names in the source may
disappear (e.g. {\tt f} is nowhere to be found because it has been turned into a
loop within main) or new names may appear from the SML basis library code that
is prefixed to your program.

You can display profiling information at the CPS basic block level with
{\tt mlprof -d 1}.

\begin{verbatim}
% mlprof -d 1 profiling mlmon.out
0.49 seconds of CPU time
tak_0                      87.76%
     tak_0          27.91%       
     L_58,L_71      18.60%       
     L_53,L_60      13.95%       
     L_56,L_72      11.63%       
     L_54,L_73       6.98%       
     L_60            6.98%       
     L_58            4.65%       
     L_56            4.65%       
     L_52            4.65%       
IntInf_smallMul (C)        12.24%
\end{verbatim}
Here, the indented {\tt tak\_0} refers to the basic block that is then entry of
the CPS {\tt tak\_0} function.  The label {\tt L\_58,L\_71} basic block in {\tt
profiling.cps}, within the {\tt tak\_0} function called {\tt L\_58}.  This basic
block also appears as label {\tt L\_71} in {\tt profiling.0.S}.

You can display profiling information at the assembly basic block level with
{\tt mlprof -d 2}.  Other {\tt mlprof} options are
{\tt -s}, which will print information about static C functions, and {\tt -t},
which will limit {\tt mlprof} to only print information about functions (or
blocks) whose percentage of time is above a certain threshold.

You may find it useful to use the {\tt -keep dot} switch when compiling {\tt
-p}, since this saves the the CPS function call graph ({\tt .call-graph.dot})
for the whole program.  Also, for each CPS function {\tt f}, it saves the
intraprocedural control-flow graph ({\tt .f.cfg.dot}) and dominator tree ({\tt
.f.dom.dot}).

The profiler works by catching the {\tt SIGPROF} signal 100 times per second and
recording where in the executable the program counter is.  Thus, if you compile
{\tt -p}, your program should not use the following, which will interfere with
the profiler.\\
\begin{tabular}{l}
\tt MLton.Itimer.set \{which = MLton.Itimer.Prof, ...\}\\
\tt MLton.Signal.Handler.set (MLton.Signal.prof, ...)
\end{tabular}\\
Also, it is best to have a long running program (at least tens of seconds) in
order to get reasonable data.
