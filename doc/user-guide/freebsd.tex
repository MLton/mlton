\subsec{Running on FreeBSD}{freebsd}

Here are the known problems using {\mlton} on FreeBSD.

\begin{itemize}

\item
The executables often run more slowly than on a comparable Linux
machine.  We conjecture that part of this is due to costs due to heap
resizing and kernel zeroing of pages.  Any help in solving the problem
would be appreciated.

\end{itemize}
