\subsection{Reporting a bug}

To report a bug, please send mail to {\mltonmail}.  Please include the
complete SML program that caused the problem and a log of a compile of
the program with {\tt -verbose 2}.

\subsection{Unresolved bugs}

This section lists the known unresolved bugs in MLton.

\begin{itemize}

\item
Datatypes with free type variables are not accepted.  For example,
the following program is rejected, although it is consistent with the
Definition.
\begin{verbatim}
fun 'a f (x : 'a) =
   let datatype foo = Foo of 'a * int
   in 13
   end
\end{verbatim}
This may be an oversight in the Definition of SML, since unchecked use
of this feature can lead to type unsoundness.

\end{itemize}
