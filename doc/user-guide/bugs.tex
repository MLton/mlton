\subsection{Reporting a bug}

To report a bug, please send mail to {\mltonmail}.  Please include the
complete SML program that caused the problem and a log of a compile of
the program with the {\tt -v2} flag.

\subsection{Unresolved bugs}

This section lists the known unresolved bugs in MLton or in the basis
library implementation.  It does not list unimplemented portions of
the basis library.

\begin{itemize}

\item
{\tt Real.fmt}, {\tt Real.toString}, {\tt Real.fromString},
{\tt Real.scan}
do not match the basis library specification.

\item
Datatypes with free type variables are not accepted.  For example,
the following program is rejected, although it is consistent with the
Definition.
\begin{verbatim}
fun 'a f (x : 'a) =
   let datatype foo = Foo of 'a * int
   in 13
   end
\end{verbatim}
This may, in fact, be an oversight in the Definition of SML, since
unchecked use of this feature can lead to type unsoundness.

\end{itemize}
