\begin{description}

\drawback{large compile-time memory requirement}
Because {\mlton} performs whole-program analysis and optimization,
compilation requires a large amount of memory.  For example, compiling
{\mlton} (over 100K lines) requires at least 512M RAM.

\drawback{long compile times}
Whole-program compilation can take a long time on large programs.  For
example, compiling {\mlton} (over 100K lines) on a 1.6GhZ machine
takes ten minutes.

\drawback{no interactive top level}
Because of whole-program compilation, {\mlton} does not provide an
interactive top level.  In particular, it does not implement the
optional {\tt use} basis library function.
