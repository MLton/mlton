Installation instructions for ML-Yacc
-------------------------------------

ML-Yacc will normally be automatically
installed as part of the SML/NJ system
by the SML/NJ installer.

To install by hand (e.g., if you make
your own modifications), run the

    ./build

script in this directory and then move
the file

    src/ml-yacc.$ARCH-$OS

to the heap-file directory.

Running ./build requires a properly
functioning installation of SML/NJ.
If you make modifications to lexer or
parser, be sure to also have properly
functioning instances of ml-lex and
ml-yacc installed before you run
./build.
