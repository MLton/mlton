(* shifts: compute the core sets that result from shift/gotoing on

   (1) compute the core sets that result just from items added

   (2) then add the shift/gotos on kernal items.

   We can do (1) the following way.  Keep a table  which for each shift/goto
symbol gives the list of items that result from shifting or gotoing on the
symbol.  Compute the nonterminals that would have dots before them in the
closure of the kernal set.  For each of these nonterminals, we already have an
item list in sorted order for each possible shift symbol.  Scan the nonterminal
list from back to front.  For each nonterminal, prepend the shift/goto list
for each shift symbol to the list already in the table.

   We end up with the list of items in correct order for each shift/goto
symbol.  We have kept the item lists in order, scanned the nonterminals from
back to front (=> that the items end up in ascending order), and never had any
duplicate items (each item is derived from only one nonterminal). *)
