(* rules for resolving conflicts:

        shift/reduce:

                  If either the terminal or the rule has no
                  precedence, a shift/reduce conflict is reported.
                  A shift is chosen for the table.

                  If both have precedences, the action with the
                  higher precedence is chosen.

                  If the precedences are equal, neither the
                  shift nor the reduce is chosen.

      reduce/reduce:

                  A reduce/reduce conflict is reported.  The lowest
                  numbered rule is chosen for reduction.
*)


(* method for filling tables - first compute the reductions called for in a
   state, then add the shifts for the state to this information.

How to compute the reductions:

   A reduction initially is given as an item and a lookahead set calling
for reduction by that item.  The first reduction is mapped to a list of
terminal * rule pairs.  Each additional reduction is then merged into this
list and reduce/reduce conflicts are resolved according to the rule
given.

Missed Errors:

   This method misses some reduce/reduce conflicts that exist because
some reductions are removed from the list before conflicting reductions
can be compared against them.  All reduce/reduce conflicts, however,
can be generated given a list of the reduce/reduce conflicts generated
by this method.
        
   This can be done by taking the transitive closure of the relation given
by the list.  If reduce/reduce (a,b) and reduce/reduce (b,c)  are true,
then reduce/reduce (a,c) is true.   The relation is symmetric and transitive.
                  
Adding shifts:

    Finally scan the list merging in shifts and resolving conflicts
according to the rule given.

Missed Shift/Reduce Errors:

    Some errors may be missed by this method because some reductions were
removed as the result of reduce/reduce conflicts.  For a shift/reduce
conflict of term a, reduction by rule n, shift/reduce conficts exist
for all rules y such that reduce/reduce (x,y) or reduce/reduce (y,x)
is true.
